# What is vkroots?

vkroots is a framework for writing Vulkan layers that takes **all** the complexity/hastle away from you! It's so simple!

## Example

vkroots is incredibly easy to integrate into your project, it's a single `#include`, and even supports
defining multiple layers in a single shared library with `VKROOTS_NEGOTIATION_INTERFACE`.

All you do is just implement the functions you want, and they are automagically hooked using C++20 concepts magic! Just watch:

```cpp
#include "vkroots.h"

#include <cstdio>

namespace MyLayer {

  class VkDeviceOverrides {
  public:
    static VkResult CreateImage(
      const vkroots::VkDeviceDispatch* pDispatch,
            VkDevice                   device,
      const VkImageCreateInfo*         pCreateInfo,
      const VkAllocationCallbacks*     pAllocator,
            VkImage*                   pImage) {
      printf("The app has made an image, I bet it's going to be frogtastically beautiful!\n");
      return pDispatch->CreateImage(device, pCreateInfo, pAllocator, pImage);
    }
  };

}

VKROOTS_DEFINE_LAYER_INTERFACES(vkroots::NoOverrides,
                                vkroots::NoOverrides,
                                MyLayer::VkDeviceOverrides);
```

## How do I pull this into my project?

You can either add this repo as a git submodule, copy the header from this repo directly, or generate it yourself with `gen/make_vkroots`.

The vkroots header can be generated from any Vulkan Registry XML (even for unreleased/non-standard extensions).
This was used, for example, in the sample [VK_FOOL_printed_surface](https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/VkLayer_FOOL_printed_surface_cups) implementation using CUPS.

# Using constexpr-evaulated ChainPatcher:
The vkroots::ChainPatcher class uses std::function & is not constexpr by default.
If you're only passing functions/lamdas into ChainPatcher, and said functions/lamdas do not do non-transient dynamic memory allocation and are constexpr-evaluatable,
then you can configure vkroots to use a constexpr alternative to std::function (the ChainPatcher constructors will also be marked as constexpr when using the constexpr alternative to std::function):

Add the following to the top of your files that include vkroots (above the `include "vkroots.h"` line):
```cpp
#define VKROOTS_USE_CONSTEXPR_FUNC 1
```

for gcc and clang, add the (highly recommended) following compiler option to your layer's build settings, to minimize any increase in code size, and allow the compiler to better optimize functions passed to vkroots::ChainPatcher:
`-fvisibility-inlines-hidden`
This ensures that the compiler is able to optimize the function callbacks to direct function calls.
 
(you can also add `-fno-rtti` and/or `-fvisibility-ms-compat`, if your codebase supports it, to further reduce binary size)

## Dependencies

There are no dependencies other a C++20-capable compiler.

If you wish to generate the `vkroots.h` header from a Vulkan Registry XML, you will need Python 3.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the project or have any feature requests, please feel free to make an issue or a pull request.
